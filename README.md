# Scalable Application Architectures

This repository contains a collection of several application architectures that were designed as part of a Scalable Software Architectures course that I took in Winter Quarter 2021. Each architecture was designed in order to maximize the ease of both rapid application deployment as well as future scalability. Each of these application architectures facilitate progressive and dynamic horizontal scaling of the application as its user base and resource needs grow.
